qemu-examples
===============

This repo contains examples, which are built to run on QEMU, but are not part of official iSYSTEM examples package, because we do not want to support them officially (eg. not working well because of bug in QEMU), but may need them internally.

Examples use same code for demonstration after every necessary platform specific thing is set up.
_old folders contain examples not using common main() code.
